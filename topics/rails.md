Working with Rails - March 17, 2017
- Today I added a new feature to my simple blogging platform. 
I added a search functionality to able to view all the posts. I used ransack for 
basic searching and I learned how the gem works and was able to use it on my system.

Authorization - April 17, 2017
- Yesterday, April 16, 2017, I started to learn how to authorize a user in a rails app.
I learned about Cancancan gem which is a library that restricts user what resources he is allowed to access, how it is use in the rails app and how to create abilities. I applied the gem on my [Pictogramm](https://github.com/leighayanid/pictogramm) app, and authorize a user to make changes in his own photos and only allow other user to read/view photos.
